Current goal:
- [ ] liouville theorem
  - [ ] A lemma
    To this end, I am following the spirit of the proof from [wikipeida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liouville_number#Liouville_numbers_and_transcendence).
  - [ ] This lemma leads to that all liouville number (if exists at all) are transcendental
- [x] construct a liouville number
- [ ] prove that it is a liouville number
- [ ] eventually, the liouville sum is transcendental.


Done:
- [x] a bunch of set to be the same size.
  - [x] hence algebraic number is countable. 
- [x] transcendental number exists.
